Face Recognition project 

This project is basicaly based on Face Recognition for online examination point of view and can be taken as the survilliance system. 
As we are giving online examination on camera. while the camera is detecting our face it could not capture our face on streaming mode as it actually take catures of face in a particualar interval of time. So in that mean i had ready an system like this it could genrate an alert or pop notification while it was capturing the candidate's face.

Is basically provide us an alert or pop-up notification while detecting the face as the face got tilted ore than a fixed threshold in number of times.

It generally shows that some unexceptable behaviour is may be happening during online examination by the candidate and in the next the examiner will take appropriate action or warned that it would not being acceptable at all.
